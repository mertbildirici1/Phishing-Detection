This project aims to develop a phishing detection system utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to identify potentially malicious 
content within emails and messages, providing an additional layer of security for users.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
- Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
- PowerBI for visualization and presentation

## Key Features

- Utilizes NLP to analyze text content for phishing indicators.
- Trains a machine learning model to classify messages as either phishing or legitimate.
- Implements a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
